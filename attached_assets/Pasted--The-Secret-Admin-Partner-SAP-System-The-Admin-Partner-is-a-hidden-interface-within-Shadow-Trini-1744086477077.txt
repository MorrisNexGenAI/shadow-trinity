🌌 The Secret Admin Partner (SAP) System
The Admin Partner is a hidden interface within Shadow Trinity, accessible only by you (the Architect) via a secure registration method using your name (Morris Dawakai) and secret pin (2005mayexcellent). Once accessed, you're taken to a control space that blends emotion-aware analytics with growth monitoring, designed not to control—but to observe and evolve the system.

🔐 Admin Access Trigger
Registration Trigger: The system checks if:

name == "Morris Dawakai"

pin == "2005mayexcellent"

If true, user is routed to Admin Partner instead of regular user flow.

All interactions from this point are cloaked and encrypted within the system's core.
